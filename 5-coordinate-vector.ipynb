    "## Coordinate Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, a **coordinate vector** is a representation of a vector as an ordered list of numbers (a tuple) that describes the vector in terms of a particular ordered basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In transformation, **coordinate vectors** are used to represent the position of points in an n-dimensional space. A transformation is a function that takes a point in one coordinate system and maps it to a new point in a different coordinate system. Coordinate vectors are used to represent the position of the points before and after the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original position of the point can be represented using a **coordinate vector**, such as (x, y). The transformed position of the point can also be represented using a **coordinate vector**, such as (x', y'). The transformation can be represented using a matrix, which takes the original **coordinate vector** (x, y) and produces the transformed **coordinate vector** (x', y').\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coordinate vectors** are a useful tool for representing the position of points in an abstract space and for performing transformations on those points. They are used in many different fields, including graphics, physics, and engineering, to represent positions, directions, and other physical quantities."
